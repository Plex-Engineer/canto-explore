## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`app/page.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22app%2Fpage.tsx%22%2C%22app%2Fpage.tsx%22%5D "app/page.tsx"). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

This project is a Next.js application with a focus on modular design. The main parts of the application are:

- [`app/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22app%2F%22%5D "app/"): Contains global styles, layout, and main page component.
- [`components/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22components%2F%22%5D "components/"): Contains reusable components like cards, dropdowns, inputs, and text elements.
- [`config/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22config%2F%22%5D "config/"): Contains configuration data for the application.
- [`fonts/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22fonts%2F%22%5D "fonts/"): Contains custom fonts used in the application.
- [`hooks/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22hooks%2F%22%5D "hooks/"): Contains custom React hooks, like `useMobile`.
- [`public/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22public%2F%22%5D "public/"): Contains public assets like images.
- [`sections/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22sections%2F%22%5D "sections/"): Contains components for different sections of the application, like the footer, navbar, and various content sections.

## Customization

You can customize the application by editing the components and configuration data. For example, you can add new sections by creating new components in the [`sections/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22sections%2F%22%5D "sections/") directory, or change the global styles by editing [`app/globals.scss`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22app%2Fglobals.scss%22%5D "app/globals.scss").
